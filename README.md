To extract specific information like the sport name, venue, and time from a text, you can use a combination of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and text classification techniques. The NER can help you identify entities like venue and time, while text classification can be used for classifying the sport name. Here's a simple example using the spaCy library for NER and text classification:

    Install the required packages:
    
    ```pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Implement the extraction and classification functions:

```
import spacy
import re

# Load the English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Train a text classifier for sport names
def train_sport_classifier(nlp, data):
    # Prepare the training data
    training_data = []
    for sport, text in data:
        doc = nlp(text)
        training_data.append((doc, [{"cats": {sport: 1.0}}]))

    # Create a text classifier pipe
    textcat = nlp.create_pipe("textcat", config={"exclusive_classes": True, "architecture": "simple_cnn"})
    nlp.add_pipe(textcat, last=True)

    # Add the sport labels to the text classifier
    for sport, _ in data:
        textcat.add_label(sport)

    # Train the text classifier
    optimizer = nlp.begin_training()
    for i in range(10):
        for doc, gold in training_data:
            nlp.update([doc], [gold], sgd=optimizer)

# Extract the venue and time using spaCy NER
def extract_venue_time(doc):
    venue = None
    time = None

    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == "GPE":
            venue = ent.text
        elif ent.label_ == "TIME":
            time = ent.text
    return venue, time

# Predict the sport name using the text classifier
def predict_sport(nlp, text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    sport = max(doc.cats, key=doc.cats.get)
    return sport

# Example data
data = [
    ("soccer", "The soccer match was held at Wembley Stadium yesterday evening."),
    ("basketball", "The basketball game took place in Madison Square Garden last night."),
    ("baseball", "Yankee Stadium hosted a baseball match this afternoon."),
]

# Train the sport classifier
train_sport_classifier(nlp, data)

# Example text
text = "A soccer game will be held at Emirates Stadium tonight."

# Extract venue and time using spaCy NER
doc = nlp(text)
venue, time = extract_venue_time(doc)
print(f"Venue: {venue}\nTime: {time}")

# Predict sport using the text classifier
sport = predict_sport(nlp, text)
print(f"Sport: {sport}")
```
This example uses the spaCy library to extract the venue and time information with its NER model, and trains a custom text classifier to classify the sport name. Note that this is a simple example with a small dataset. For better accuracy and performance, you may need to train your NER model and the text classifier with more data.
