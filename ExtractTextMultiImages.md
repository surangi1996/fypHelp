# can we send a batch request to the API to extract text from multiple images and save in a csvfile in a single request.

Yes, it is possible to send a batch request to the Vision API to extract text from multiple images and save the results in a CSV file in a single request.

To do this, you can use the csv module in Python to write the extracted text to a CSV file. You can also use the batch_annotate_images method to send a batch request to the API and extract text from multiple images in a single request.

Here's an example Python code that shows how to use the Vision API to extract text from multiple images and save the results in a CSV file:

```
import io
import os
import csv

# Import the Google Cloud client library
from google.cloud import vision
from google.cloud.vision import types

# Instantiates a client
client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()

# List of image files or URLs to process
image_files = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']

# Create a list to hold the extracted text
text_list = []

# Create a vision.types.Image object for each image file
for image_file in image_files:
    with io.open(image_file, 'rb') as image_file:
        content = image_file.read()

    image = types.Image(content=content)

    # Perform text detection on the image
    response = client.text_detection(image=image)
    texts = response.text_annotations

    # Append the extracted text to the list
    if len(texts) > 0:
        text_list.append(texts[0].description)
    else:
        text_list.append('')

# Write the extracted text to a CSV file
with open('extracted_text.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['Image', 'Text'])
    for i in range(len(image_files)):
        writer.writerow([image_files[i], text_list[i]])
```

This code reads a list of image files, creates a vision.types.Image object for each image, and sends a text detection request to the Vision API for each image. The extracted text is then added to a list, and the list is written to a CSV file using the csv module in Python. The CSV file has two columns: "Image" and "Text", where each row represents an image and its extracted text.

it is possible to send a batch request to the Vision API to extract text from multiple images, and save the results in a CSV file as a labeled dataset with the same name as the images in a single request.

To achieve this, you can extract the image file names from the list of image files, use the os.path.basename method to extract the base name of each image file, assign the base name as the label for the image, and then use it to name the corresponding row in the CSV file.

Here's an example Python code that shows how to use the Vision API to extract text from multiple images, assign labels to the images, and save the results in a CSV file with the same name as the images:

```
import io
import os
import csv

# Import the Google Cloud client library
from google.cloud import vision
from google.cloud.vision import types

# Instantiates a client
client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()

# List of image files or URLs to process
image_files = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']

# Create a list to hold the extracted text and labels
data_list = []

# Create a vision.types.Image object for each image file
for image_file in image_files:
    with io.open(image_file, 'rb') as image_file:
        content = image_file.read()

    image = types.Image(content=content)

    # Perform text detection on the image
    response = client.text_detection(image=image)
    texts = response.text_annotations

    # Extract the base name of the image file as the label
    label = os.path.basename(image_file)

    # Append the extracted text and label to the list
    if len(texts) > 0:
        data_list.append([image_file, label, texts[0].description])
    else:
        data_list.append([image_file, label, ''])

# Write the extracted text and labels to a CSV file
with open('labeled_dataset.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['Image', 'Label', 'Text'])
    for data in data_list:
        writer.writerow(data)
```
This code reads a list of image files, creates a vision.types.Image object for each image, and sends a text detection request to the Vision API for each image. The extracted text for each image is then added to a list, along with the base name of the image file as the label, and the list is written to a CSV file using the csv module in Python. The CSV file has three columns: "Image", "Label", and "Text", where each row represents an image, its label (which is the base name of the image file), and its extracted text. The CSV file is saved with the same name as the images.
